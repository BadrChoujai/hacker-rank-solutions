# Welcome to my HackerRank Repository 

## What is HackerRank?
[__HackerRank__](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is a place where programmers from all over the world come together to solve problems in a wide range of Computer Science domains such as algorithms, machine learning/ AI, as well as to practice different programming languages like - `Python`, `C`, `SQL`, `Linux Shell` etc. and also different programming paradigms like - `Functional Programming`, `Statistic`s etc. To know more details about `HackerRank` you can  [___visit here___](https://www.hackerrank.com/faq). 


## What this repository contains?

This repository contains solutions of problems from different domains of HackerRank that matches my interest. You can see the domains listed below. Most of the problems are solved using - `Python`, `Bash` & `MySQL`.
